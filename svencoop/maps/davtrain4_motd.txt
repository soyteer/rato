DAV Train
=========

The SC Team refused the G-man's job offer, and find themselves in a cargo carriage in Black Mesa Materials Transport Sector to be taken to a remote location and have their memories erased.
The team must now arm themselves and fight their way through the facility and face HECU soldiers and otherworldy creatures from another dimension to escape their demise.

The sector is under full lockdown, and the team must first reclaim a stolen keycard to be able to unlock the only exit of the sector, where the rescue vehicle awaits them. 
However, the bad guys won't make this task easy, and will do everything in their power to stop the SC Team from escaping...

Will you emerge victorious?
